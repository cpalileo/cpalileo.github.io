# React version of my portfolio page

## Original vanilla HTML/CSS website can be found at [https://cpalileo.github.io/cpalileo-portfolio/]

### Concept: The website is supposed to be likened to a whiteboard as commonly used in technical interviews. While the original website more closely resembles my ideas, the full realization of my vision for the website is limited with vanilla HTML/CSS.

### Future Development: My hope is to periodically work on this website to present more interactive feature that give more of a "whiteboard" feel.
